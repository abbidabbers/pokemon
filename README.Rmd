`pokemon` is an R package that contains Pokémon-related datasets. The first [Pokémon video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)) came out in 1996, and Nintendo has since released nine generations of games, including 37 individual games in the main series. It is one of the best-selling video game series and is actively played by millions of people. The Pokédex is a comprehensive collection of stats for all Pokémon in the series, which has made it the most common Pokémon-related data to collect. However, in the past, only a limited subset of Pokédex data was available in data sets, so this package expands the availability by including data sets related to items and moves, plus an expanded Pokédex. Our datasets use information retrieved from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co), a public database of Pokémon-related data with an API interface. However, our package is not a wrapper package for the API because it only contains the datasets automatically available to the user. Our goal in creating this package is to make a design that allows users to view and easily interact with extensive Pokémon-related data without being forced to collect it themselves because no such package currently exists (to our knowledge). This package can help create visualizations to compare different types of Pokémon, analyze various items, examine the prevalence of particular moves, and more. It allows Pokémon enthusiasts and those hunting for datasets to perform Pokémon-related data analysis more smoothly.

Note some limitations: This data does not account for the most recent Pokémon game releases, Pokémon Shining Pearl and Brilliant Diamond, and Pokémon Legends: Arceus, because the API has not yet added it to their database. It also does not incorporate data from the upcoming games, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet (scheduled for release in Fall 2022). According to the PokéAPI's documentation, some Pokémon Sword and Shield data may be inaccurate because of the method they used to obtain the information. Additionally, some information from the API has not been added or updated (we tried to use variables that have data for all generations).

## Installation

You can install the development version of pokemon from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("abbidabbers/pokemon")
```

## Load

```{r}
library(pokemon)
```

## Available Tables

-   `pokedex`: Detailed organizer for data included in the Pokédex such as order, name, types, species, height, weight, abilities, base experience, and stats for each Pokémon.
-   `item_index`: Metadata about items in the Pokémon games, such as item name, cost, category, and attributes, the power and effect of the move "Fling" when used with this item, and the Pokémon that can hold it.
-   `moves_index`: A collection of data about moves in the Pokémon games, including name, accuracy, power, and generation release.

## Example: Pokédex

```{r example, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

head(pokemon::pokedex)

ggplot2::ggplot(data = pokemon::pokedex, aes(x = total, y = catch)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~growth) +
  labs(title = "Catch Rate vs. Total Stat Value, Separated by Growth Rate", x = "Total Stat Value", y = "Catch Rate")
```
